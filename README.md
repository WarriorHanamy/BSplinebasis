# BSplinebasis
This repository contains a small, template-based BSpline library in C++ (>= C++17), geared towards the use as basis functions in analytical problems. The spline implementation is contained in include/okruz/bspline/Spline.h, with additional code for interpolation (currently based on Eigen or armadillo) and integration.

Docs can be found [here](https://okruz.github.io/BSplinebasis/).
