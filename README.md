# BSplinebasis
This repository contains a small, template-based BSpline library in C++ (>= C++17), geared towards the use as basis functions in analytical problems. The spline implementation is contained in include/spline-template.h, with additional code for interpolation (currently based on Eigen) and integration in the other header files.
